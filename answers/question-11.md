In Ubuntu/Linux, you can create an empty file in several ways. Here are the most common:

1. Using touch
touch filename.txt


✅ Creates an empty file called filename.txt.

2. Using > redirection
> filename.txt


✅ Also creates an empty file (or clears it if it exists).

3. Using nano or other editors
nano filename.txt


Opens a text editor.

Just save and exit to create the file.

The easiest method is usually touch filename.txt.
