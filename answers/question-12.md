cp and mv are both used to move files or directories, but they work differently:

cp (copy) → makes a copy of a file or directory.

cp file1.txt file2.txt   # file2.txt is a copy of file1.txt


mv (move/rename) → moves a file or directory to a new location or renames it.

mv file1.txt folder/      # moves file1.txt into folder
mv oldname.txt newname.txt  # renames the file


✅ In short: cp duplicates, mv moves or renames.
