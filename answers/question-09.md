In Ubuntu/Linux, you create a directory using the mkdir command.

Examples:

Create a single directory

mkdir folder_name


Create nested directories (parent directories created automatically)

mkdir -p parent_folder/child_folder


Create a directory with a message for confirmation

mkdir -v new_folder


This will make a new folder in your current location (or specified path).
