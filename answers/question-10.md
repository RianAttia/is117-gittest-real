Absolute path is the full path from the root directory / to a file or folder.
Example:

/home/user/Documents/file.txt


Relative path is the path relative to your current directory.
Example (if you’re in /home/user):

Documents/file.txt


✅ In short: absolute = complete address, relative = address from where you are now.
