The cat command in Linux is used to display the contents of a file in the terminal.

Examples:

Show a file’s content

cat file.txt


Combine multiple files

cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt


This creates a new file combined.txt containing the contents of both files.

Create a file quickly

cat > newfile.txt


Then type text and press Ctrl+D to save.

✅ In short: cat = view, combine, or create files.
