The command rm -rf is dangerous because it forcefully and recursively deletes files and directories without any confirmation.

-r → deletes directories and all their contents, including subdirectories.

-f → ignores warnings and prompts, deleting everything immediately.

A small typo or wrong path can wipe important files or even your entire system, and recovery is usually impossible.

Always double-check the path before using rm -rf.
